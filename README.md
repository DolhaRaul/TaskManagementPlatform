# Use flow
The application redirects to the *HomePage*, where the main functionality of the app is presented. Here, the user
may view how the collections of tasks is stored, the way it can *add / delete / modify* the to-do repsonsibilities. 
Although interactions are possible, login is required in order for them to be functionable. The *Login Page* may be accesed either by accesing the Login Button, or by clicking the *Login* from the navigation bar. They both act as redirectors to the Login Page.

***Note*** The current page that the user is currently on is higlighted in green, in the navigation bar. Also, the *Logged In / Logged Out status* is infered by the *Login / LogOut button*, in the LoginPage.

In the **Login Page**, after the credentials have been introduced and for each the checkmark âœ… has appeared, the Login Process begins. There are two possible outcomes:
- The Login is succesfully made, the user being redirected to the **Home Page**, where he can handle his list of tasks.

- The Login Failed ,either due to wrongly introduced credentials or trying  to acces the platform with a non-existing account. In the later case, **Register is required**, which may be done either by cliking the *Register* from the navigation bar, or by clicking the *To Do Image* in the Login Page.

In the **Register Page** all fields are mandatory, each following specific patterns, that need to be followed. Some inputs are automatically completed based on information provided by the user (for instance, the Country is automatically chosen based on the user's city pick)

**Register** may fail if and only if there already exists a user with the specific email (this being unique per person), the user being alerted such is the case. 

After the **Register** is successfully finished, the user is alerted and before being automatically redirected to the **LoginPage**, where the scenario has been previously  explained.

# Additional features
1. The _About Owner Page_ presents extra information regarding the site owner, stored in a table, that the user may
   user view / filter / order / etc, in order to better search personal data of him (these **features** will prove deem themselves even more useful when more personal data will be added in the future )
2. The _About Owner Page_ offers "Profile Image Picker" functionality, from a gamma of predefined profile pictures.
3. **Important**: Personal info of already existing accounts may modified solely by the admin itself, the user with the following credentials(these are not important credentials, solely for testing purposes):
   - Email: rauldolha2002@yahoo.com
   - Password:raul1234
  The **Admin User** has the capability of altering user's accounts (if needed, *evev* permanently deleting their accounts) through the **Users' Page**. Here, the user's credentials
  are changed by the admin through a new form, similar to the one in the **Register Page**

# Use flow
The application redirects to the *HomePage*, where the main functionality of the app is presented. Here, the user
may view how the collections of tasks are stored, and the way it can *add/delete/modify* the to-do responsibilities. 
Although interactions are possible, login is required in order for them to be functional. The *Login Page* may be accessed either by accessing the Login Button or by clicking the *Login* from the navigation bar. They both act as redirectors to the Login Page.

***Note*** The page that the user is currently on is highlighted in light blue, in the navigation bar. Also, the *Logged In / Logged Out status* is inferred by the *Login / LogOut button*, in the LoginPage.

In the **Login Page**, after the credentials have been introduced and each checkmark ✅ has appeared, the Login Process begins. There are two possible outcomes:
- The Login is successfully made, and the user is redirected to the **Home Page**, where he can handle his list of tasks.

- The Login Failed, either due to wrongly introduced credentials or trying  to access the platform with a non-existing account. In the later case, **Register is required**, which may be done either by clicking the *Register* from the navigation bar, or by clicking the *To Do Image* on the Login Page.

In the **Register Page** all fields are mandatory, each following specific patterns, that need to be followed. Some inputs are automatically completed based on information provided by the user (for instance, the Country is automatically chosen based on the user's city pick)

**Register** may fail if and only if there already exists a user with the specific email (this being unique per person), the user being alerted such is the case. 

After the **Register** is successfully finished, the user is alerted and before being automatically redirected to the **LoginPage**, where the scenario has been previously  explained.

# Additional features
1. The _About Owner Page_ presents extra information regarding the site owner, stored in a table, that the user may
   user view/filter/order / etc, in order to better search personal data him (these **features** will prove to deem themselves even more useful when more personal data is added in the future )
2. The _About Owner Page_ offers "Profile Image Picker" functionality, from a gamma of predefined profile pictures.
3. **Important**: Personal info of already existing accounts may modified solely by the admin itself, the user with the following credentials(these are not important credentials, solely for testing purposes):
   - Email: rauldolha2002@yahoo.com
   - Password:raul1234
  The **Admin User** has the capability of altering user's accounts (if needed, *even* permanently deleting their accounts) through the **Users' Page**. Here, the user's credentials
  are changed by the admin through a new form, similar to the one in the **Register Page**

5. (*Future improvements will be added*) A tracking functionality that counts how many users from each Country are out there, using the app. There are also features like filtering/ordering/etc for these
